# Using a pre-trained model with a library like TensorFlow or PyTorch
# Code for this task can be quite complex and is typically implemented using deep learning frameworks.
# Here's a simplified example using a hypothetical library called neural_style_transfer_library:

from neural_style_transfer_library import NSTModel

content_image_path = 'content.jpg'
style_image_path = 'style.jpg'

nst_model = NSTModel()
result_image = nst_model.transfer_style(content_image_path, style_image_path)

result_image.save('result.jpg')
